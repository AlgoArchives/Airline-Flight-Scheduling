# Airline-Flight-Scheduling


1. Create the Flight Network Graph:

    Define the airports as nodes in the graph.
    Define the flights between airports as edges in the graph.
    Assign capacities to the flights based on the number of passengers they can transport.


2. Implement an Algorithm:

    You can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or its variants like the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to find the maximum flow through the network.
    The maximum flow represents the maximum number of passengers that can be transported from the origin airports to the destination airports.



3. Optimization:

    You may need to consider constraints such as flight times, layovers, and connecting flights while optimizing the schedule.
    You can introduce additional parameters or constraints in the flow network model to account for these factors.



4. Python Implementation:

    Use the NetworkX library to create the graph and run the chosen algorithm to find the maximum flow.
    You can also use libraries like PuLP for linear programming to optimize the schedule further based on specific constraints.
